          Real estate is property consisting of land and the buildings on it,
          along with its natural resources such as crops, minerals or water;
          immovable property of this nature; an interest vested in this (also)
          an item of real property, (more generally) buildings or housing in
          general <br />
          Real estate is different from personal property, which is not
          permanently attached to the land, such as vehicles, boats, jewelry,
          furniture, tools and the rolling stock of a farm.

          Residential real estate may contain either a single family or
          multifamily structure that is available for occupation or for
          non-business purposes.[3] Residences can be classified by and how they
          are connected to neighbouring residences and land. Different types of
          housing tenure can be used for the same physical type. For example,
          connected residences might be owned by a single entity and leased out,
          or owned separately with an agreement covering the relationship
          between units and common areas and concerns.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          In markets where land and building prices are rising, real estate is
          often purchased as an investment, whether or not the owner intends to
          use the property. Often investment properties are rented out, but
          "flipping" involves quickly reselling a property, sometimes taking
          advantage of arbitrage or quickly rising value, and sometimes after
          repairs are made that substantially raise the value of the property.
